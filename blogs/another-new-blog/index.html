<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>
    Soooooo, in the background I have been working on more things to add to this website and
    I have decided to also move over my blog to here as well. So you will start to see content
    move over to this page instead of the old blogger page.
</p>

<p>I will keep that up anyway, but will probably stop posting on it and instead just update this website instead.</p>

<h3>About the custom links</h3>
<p>
    You may also have seen all my custom links have stopped working (github.iwick.dev, discord.iwick.dev, etc)
    as you may have heard Google Domains is no longer a thing (RIP) that is where I had all of these hosted.
    So I don't have them anymore, but my main page (https://iwick.dev) will have all my links instead.
    I will keep them updated there so if you find an old dead link, check there for the updated ones.
</p>
