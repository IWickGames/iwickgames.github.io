<p>
    I often get asked or see people ask if something is malicious with a link to a VirusTotal result
    often with one or two vendors saying the file is malicious even if the file is well known or even
    distributed and signed from someone like Microsoft. So let's talk about VirusTotal.
</p>

<p>
    <b>TL;DR</b> Never take anything from VirusTotal at face value. It does not understand the context of what your uploading
    and the scanners are not always correct, plus are not being used to their full potential to detect malware.

    Now lets go into details.
</p>

<h2>The score is not everything</h2>
<p>
    <b>ALWAYS</b> look deeper than just the number at the top of the screen. VirusTotal has A-LOT of vendors now,
    63 at the time of writing this. However not all are equal. While you will see ones you know
    like BitDefender, Malware-bytes, Kaspersky, etc., you will also see some you have never heard of.
    There is a good chance you may come across one of these vendors/scanners reporting a file is malicious even if they
    are potentially the ONLY scanner that does. This is a quick way to tell if something is likely a false positive.
</p>

<h2>Scanners are not using their full potential</h2>
<p>
    VirusTotal is a static analysis site for the most part. This means that all the scanners you see are not executing
    the file, just looking at the content and attempting to match signatures, hashes, etc. This can cause a malicious
    file to show up clean on VirusTotal, even if it would be caught by the AV running on your system due to
    heuristics or other dynamic analysis.
</p>

<h2>Unrelated YARA Rules</h2>
<p>
    Before I can get into this one, let me first define what Yara rules are.

    Yara is a language that allows anyone to create matching conditions on data as "rules". These rules can then be loaded
    into a Yara interpreter and run on a set of data to determine if it matches the selected rule. It is often used to
    do static analysis and to find files that contain certain patterns such as import a certain library or make certain
    system calls.
</p>

<p>
    Ok now back to how this applies to VirusTotal, well... VirusTotal allows researchers to upload their Yara rules
    and use them to search VirusTotal for samples that match. However, these rules may be very generic or apply to loads
    of applications. You might see them float above your results page in red. Make sure you <b>READ</b> the name and
    description, it will give you details about what exactly the match is for, which you can use with your context to
    determine if It's valid to be concerned about or not.
</p>

<p>
    For example, you have a "calculator app" and decide to check it with VirusTotal. It has two detections, but
    you are not sure if it's a false positive or not. However, you see a Yara match for the app making a syscall to
    elevate its permissions. Now lets think, why would a calculator app need to elevate its permissions?
    Seems weird right? Exactly. This is how you should use them, if you have an installer application and a Yara rule
    matches for it dropping files to the temp folder. Well now this time that's a lot more reasonable due to us knowing
    it's an installer.

<p>Just because something matches does not mean it's malicious!</p>

<h2>Comments and Ratings</h2>
<p>
    Now I am not saying everyone is wrong who posts in there. There are people who post research there that is helpful,
    however there are many bots that posts automated comments on VirusTotal pages or random people who post ratings that
    are incorrect or more opinionated than fact. Just because you see something that says its malicious as a comment, does
    not always mean its correct just like all the other features. You have to take into account the other info on the page.
</p>

<p>
    Here is an example of it going on, with FileScanIO (an automated analysis tool). It's giving the official
    Steam installer a 100/100 malware rating.

</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>
    Now with all of that let me say, VirusTotal is not a bad tool. It's an amazing one. However, with every tool it has
    its problems and although is very accessible is not really for people who don't know anything about malware.
    It can be easy to be misled into believing something is malware when it's completely safe. Or give you a false sense
    of security that an application is safe when it's not. Let this be a lesson on why to never take anything you
    see at face value, especially with analysis tools.
